# Express Server Port Conflict

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when running an Express.js server: the port is already in use by another process.  The example shows how to reproduce the error and provides a solution.

## Reproducing the Error

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `node bug.js`.
3. Observe the error message indicating the port is in use.

## Solution

The solution involves identifying the process that's using the specified port and either terminating it or changing the port in your Express.js application. The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates changing the port number.

## Additional Notes

This issue typically arises when multiple applications attempt to use the same port. If another application (e.g., a different Node.js process or another type of service) is already bound to that port, your Express server won't be able to start.

Consider using a tool like `lsof` (Linux/macOS) or `netstat` (Windows) to find the process using the specified port.
